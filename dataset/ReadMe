This ReadMe describes the 4 files that contain the full set of parameters accompanying the 
spectral simulations made for CU8. Each file is named according to their spectral library 
used as input for simulations. 
Each line of the files gives, for a star with the specified physical parameters, the derived 
magnitudes, extinctions and color excesses based on a specific simulated spectra. 
See the table at the end of this Readme for a detailed description of each column.


We produced these simulations at a fixed apparent G magnitude of 15 mag (GG) and we provide 
the corresponding GBP and GRP for each source.

Simulations of BP/RP spectra are needed to develop/prepare some CU8 Apsis modules. A simulator 
developed in DPAC by CU5 takes as input a higher resolution, not-normalized spectra. CU8 
collected a series of spectral libraries for this purpose, and in DR3 Apsis used these four
libraries: MARCS, PHOENIX, A, OB.
Full details on simulations and spectral libraries are given in Section 11.2.3 of the Gaia DR3 

A synthetic spectrum is defined by its effective temperature (teff), surface gravity (logg), 
and metallicity [M/H]. We provide [Fe/H] (feH) and [alpha/Fe] (alphaFe), and [M/H] = [Fe/H] + 
[alpha/Fe]. 
The spectral libraries available to CU8 are computed at discrete values of teff, logg, feH.
alphaFe is fixed to the solar values (=0.0) for all but the MARCS library, which allows [alpha/Fe]
to vary with [Fe/H]. See the documentation for more details on metallicity (Section 11.2.3).

A synthetic spectrum is normalized to a stellar unit surface, we thus need at least the radius 
(R) to obtain the absolute flux. This information is provided by evolutionary models. 
We developed a specific procedure for matching a spectrum with isochrones. A flag (parameter 
17) tags if the match is satisfactory (=0) or not (=1). 
See Section 11.2.3 of the Gaia DR3 online documentation for details. 
Once the radius of the star is known, we can scale the synthetic spectrum to simulate the 
absolute flux of the star (at 10 pc), and using the eDR3 passbands we can derive the absolute 
magnitude MG. Given MG, the extinction in the G band AG and the apparent magnitude GG, we can 
derive the distance (d) of the star. These quantities are needed by GSPPhot. 

The emission from a star can be attenuated by interstellar absorption. To simulate extinction,
we use the Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve. We simulated each synthetic spectrum at different 
levels of extinction, parametrized by A0 values (monochromatic extinction at 541.4 nm). Details 
are provided in Section 11.2.3 of the online documentation. From these simulations, we 
computed the photometry and extinction measurements in different passbands. Those were used 
by different steps in the preparation of Apsis and in the validation of its results. We emphasize 
that we computed the extinction measurements by integrating the reddened spectra, i.e. we did not 
use any approximation or calibration. The extinction in a given passband comes from the difference 
between the reddened magnitude and the un-reddened one.
